Above all, it’s a week for acknowledging that for all your discipline and practicality, you rely, as much as anyone else, on narrative and myth to make sense of the world. It’s not a bad thing or a weakness, but a simple truth: there’s more to the world than the things you can touch.",

        element: "Air signs are all about action, ideas, and motion—they are the “winds of change.” When a strong gust hits you, you can’t help but move. While some within their ranks may be true-life “airheads,” others are as powerful as a gravity-defying G-force. Air signs bring everyone a breath of fresh air when things start to get stale. Like the breeze, you can’t quite catch them, and you never know where they’ll drop you once they sweep you up. It will almost always been an adventure, though.", 
        cardinality: "If you are a Fixed sign, you are the second month in a season and it is your job to maintain that season. Fixed signs concentrate energy and solidify ideas. Taurus (spring), Leo (summer), Scorpio (autumn), and Aquarius (winter), are the Fixed signs.",
        scope: "It’s an uneasy way to live, feeling like certain parts of your mind are valued while the rest are only tolerated; like all the best parts of your soul are the parts that are most difficult for other people to see clearly. There are good reasons why it’s sometimes useful to be conciliatory, more broadly appealing, less difficult and strange. This week, though, trying to hide your unruly spirit is unlikely to work. Don’t start thinking that just because other people want you to be charming, your charm is the only good thing about you. Rebellion is your birthright; strangeness is your gift.",

        element: "Intuitive, emotional and ultra-sensitive, water signs can be as mysterious as the ocean itself. Like water, they can be refreshing, or they can drown you in their depths. These signs often have intense dreams and borderline-psychic intuition. Security is important to them—after all, water needs a container, or it dries up and disappears.", 
        cardinality: "Mutable signs, are the third (and final) month within each season. The role for these signs is to prepare for the transition to the next season and their traits are communication, flexibility, and destruction. In a nutshell, wrapping things up. Mutable signs are Gemini (late spring), Virgo (late summer), Sagittarius (late autumn) and Pisces (late winter).",
        scope: "This is a week to fully appreciate your curiosity and acknowledge all that you don’t know. It can feel strange and difficult to look at the gaps in your knowledge and see anything other than a deficiency to be fixed, but this week, hold onto the wisdom that comes from not knowing everything. Right now, mystery holds more potential and more life than certainty ever could. Imperfection offers the space you so desperately need to wonder and dream and move.",
